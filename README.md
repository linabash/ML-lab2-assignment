A. About Dataset:
This dataset simulates smartphone battery degradation based on real-world usage patterns, charging behavior, and thermal stress factors.
Each row represents a smartphone device with engineered features describing usage intensity, charging habits, and environmental stress. The dataset models how these factors affect battery health over time.

B. Problem Statement:
Given a user’s smartphone usage and charging behavior, predict:
1. current_battery_health_percent (regression)
2. recommended_action (classification)


C. Methodology diagram:
This diagram was generated using AI.
